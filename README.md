# latexGoodPractices
A list of Latex packages used to standardize good practices in the Northern Robotics Lab.

Read carefully and copy the file `preamble.tex` in your Latex project.
Then, start your documents with:
```
\input{preamble.tex}
```

*Don't use git submodule for this repository.* 
There are too many particularities to handle for each journal and conference.
Just copy the sources in your latex folder.
If there is a new package that the whole lab should be aware of, discuss about it in Slack and add it over here.
